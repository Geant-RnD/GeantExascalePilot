/**
 * @brief   Class to describe an element.
 * @class   Element
 * @author  M Novak, A Ribon
 * @date    december 2015
 *
 * Elements can be created:
 * 1. Directly, without specifying its isotopes (natural isotopes of the
 *    element will be taken from the NIST database i.e. NISTElementData
 *    utomatically).
 * 2. By adding its isotopes one by one using the AddIsotope() method.
 * 3. Constructing NIST elements by using the NISTElement() method.
 *
 * Each element stores a list of pointers to the isotopes from which the element
 * is built up. This can be accessed by the user through the GetIsotopeVector()
 * method.
 *
 * Each element pointer is stored in a global element table when created.
 * This table can be accessed by the user through the GetTheElementTable() method.
 *
 * \warning It's strongly not recommended to delete any elements! Each element
 * will be deleted automatically at the end of the run.
 *
 * \warning
 * When the isotopes of the element are not specified, the natural isotopes (i.e.
 * isotopes with non-zero natural isotope abundance) will be taken from NISTElementData
 * isotopic composition database. In case of elements, that does not have any
 * stable isotopes, the most stable isotope will be inserted with abundance = 1.0 and
 * the user will be informed by a warning. It is always possible to build an element
 * by specifying its isotopes with their abundances. In the case of elements, that
 * has no stable isotope we recommend to use this opportunity to build the lement.
