/**
 * @brief   Class to describe a material.
 * @class   Material
 * @author  M Novak, A Ribon
 * @date    december 2015
 *
 * Name of the materials must be unique i.e. there cannot be more than one
 * material with the same material name.\n
 * Materials can be created in different ways:
 * 1. Simple materials, that consists of only one element can be created directly.
 * 2. Complex materials, that consists of more than one elements can be build up by:
 *   -  First creating a material object by declaring the number of components the
 *      material will be built up.
 *      1. Then adding elements to the material one by one together with the
 *         (integer) number of atoms in the molecule using the AddElement() method.
 *      2. Or adding elements and/or materials to the material one by one together
 *         with their mass fraction using the AddElement() and/or AddMaterial()
 *         methods.
 * 3. Several pre-defined (NIST) materials can be constructed by their names. See
 *    the NISTMaterial() mathod for more details.
 *
 * Each material stores a list of pointers to the elements from which the material
 * is built up. This can be accessed by the user through the GetElementVector() method.
 *
 * Each material pointer is stored in a global material table when created.
 * This table can be accessed by the user through the GetTheMaterialTable() method.
 *
 * \warning It's strongly not recommended to delete any materials! Each material
 * will be deleted automatically at the end of the run.
