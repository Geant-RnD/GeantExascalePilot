/**
 * @brief   Class to describe an isotope.
 * @class   Isotope
 * @author  M Novak, A Ribon
 * @date    december 2015
 *
 * Isotopes must be unique i.e. there cannot be more than one isotope with the
 * the same values of Z(atomic numer), N(number of nucleons) and isomer level.
 * In order to ensure this:\n
 * isotopes cannot be created directly by the user. Instead, isotopes can be
 * accessed by the user through the static GetIsotope() method by specifying the
 * properties of the requested isotope. This method will return with a pointer
 * to the requested isotope (the requested isotope will be created internaly
 * only if it has not been created yet).
 *
 * Each isotope pointer is stored in a global isotope table when created.
 * This table can be accessed by the user through the static GetTheIsotopeTable()
 * method.
 *
 * \warning It's strongly not recommended to delete any isotopes! Each isotope will
 * be deleted automatically at the end of the run.
 *
 * \todo \li We might make the destructor private. With this we can prevent
 *           the user to delete any of the isotopes during the run.
 *       \li Then we can have a static DeleteAll() method that will delete all
 *           isotopes at the end of the run. Even better if we have a material
 *           manager that is friend of the Isotope (and Element and Material)
 *           class and that manager will have the DeleteAllIsotopes() method.
 *       \li Then we might have a CreateAll() method (or in the manager friend)
 *           that can create all the isotopes that has not been created yet.So
 *           first the user creates some of the isotopes (e.g. with the prefered
 *           atomic mass) then all the remaining isotopes can be created through
 *           this method.
 *      \li This manager friend class can be called at physics initialisation and
 *          at the end of the run.
