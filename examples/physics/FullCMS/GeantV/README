GeantV Full CMS Benchmark (November, 2017, M.Novak)
===============================================================================

'FullCMS' is a CPU benchmark test GeantV application based on the full CMS
detector imported via a .gdml/.root file. (The corresponding Geant4 application
is 'full-cms'.) The 'cms2018.gdml' file is available in the repository under
geant/data/cms2018.gdml and is installed at
geantInstallDir/bin/examples/FullCMS/Geant4 and geantInstallDir/bin/examples/FullCMS/GeantV


----------------------------
- DETECTOR
----------------------------

# Detector construction:
    The detector is imported from GDML file. Any GDML file can be set
    as an input argument by using the

    --det-set-gdml <gdml-file-name.gdml>

    The default value is "./cms2018.gdml".



-----------------------------
- PRIMARY GENERATOR
-----------------------------

The primary generator is a particle gun that will generate primary particles
at the (0,0,0) position with the following options:

# Number of primaries per event:
    The number of primary particles per event can be set as an input argument

    --gun-set-primary-per-event <number>

    By default, i.e. if it is not specified by the above argument, the number
    of primary particles will be randomly selected for each individual event
    from the [1, 10] interval uniformly.

# Primary particle energy:
    The primary particle energy can be set as an input argument (in [GeV] unit)

    --gun-set-primary-energy  <energy-value>

    By default, i.e. if it is not specified by the above argument, the kinetic
    energy will be randomly selected for each individual primary particle from
    the [1 GeV, 100 GeV] uniformly.

# Primary particle direction:
    The primary particle momentum direction can be set as an input argument

    --gun-set-primary-direction  x=<xdir-value>,y=<ydir-value>,z=<zdir-value>

    The user defined direction will be normalized automatically. By default,
    i.e. if it is not specified by the above argument, the momentum direction
    will be randomly selected for each individual primary particles from an
    isotropic distribution.

# Primary particle type:
    The primary particle type can be set as an input argument

    --gun-set-primary-type      <particle-name>

    By default, i.e. if it is not specified by the above argument, the type
    will be randomly selected from a pre-defined list for each individual
    primary particle uniformly. The current list of particles includes e-,
    e+ and gamma particles. It can be extended by adding more particles to
    the list in the CMSParticleGun class.


------------------------
- PHYSICS LIST
------------------------

The default GeantV physics list is used for the simulation that includes the
standrad EM processes for e- (ionization, bremsstrahlung, Coulomb scattering),
e+ (ionization, bremsstrahlung, Coulomb scattering) and gamma (photoelectric
absorption, Compton scattering, e-e+ pair production). Note, that energy loss
fluctuation and e+ annihilation are not included in the physics list. The
corresponding Geant4 physics list (MyGVPhysicsList) has been created and used
as default in the equivalent 'full-cms' Geant4 application.


-------------------------
- MAGNETIC FIELD 
-------------------------

One can activate and set a constant magnetic field by first providing value 1 

  --field-active  1/0    

field activation input argument. Then one can set the constant field vector by using the 
      
  --field-vector   x=<value>,y=<value>,z=<value>  

An example is provided in the TestEm3_GV_magField.mac script file. Further options related to 
magnetic field propagation:    

  --field-use-RK      1/0      ==>  do/don't use Runge-Kutta integration instead of helix
  --field-eps-RK      <value>  ==>  required accuracy in the field integration
  --field-basketized  1/0      ==>  do/don/t basketize for magnetic field propagation


-------------------------
- RUN CONFIGURATION
-------------------------

The application can be used both with single and multiple worker threads.
GeantV can use multiple propagators per-worker threads and transport multiple
events simultaneously (the work/tracks will be distributed among the worker
threads). The corresponding options:

# Number of worker threads:
    The number of worker threads can be specified as an input argument by

    --config-number-of-threads  <number>

# Number of propagators per-worker thread:
    The number of propagators can be specified as an input argument by

    --config-number-of-propagators <number>

# Number of buffered events:
    The number of events transported simultaneously can be set as an input
    argument by

    --config-number-of-buffered-events <number>

# Total number of events to be transported:
    The total number of events to be transported can be set as an input
    argument by

    --config-total-number-of-events  <number>

A minimal set of "observable" is collected during the simulation per-primary
particle type: mean energy deposit, mean charged and neutral step lengths,
mean number of steps made by charged and neutral particles, mean number of
secondary e-, e+ and gamma particles. The result is reported at the end of
each event for each primary particle that were transported in the given event.
At the end of the simulation a final report is printed showing the primary
generator settings used during the run, the total number of events and primary
particles transported and the per-primary type simulation statistics of the
above-mentioned quantities.

The simulation can be executed in "performance" mode by setting the

  --config-run-performance 1

input argument to 1. User actions are not invoked (early returns) in this
case. Therefore, there is no any scoring in this case.


-------------------------
- EXAMPLE
-------------------------

The 'FullCMS.mac' script is provided as an example to simulate 10 events in the
CMS detector such that each event will contain 2 primary electrons with 10 GeV
kinetic energy pointing to a fixed direction. 4 events will be taken and
transported simultaneously by using 4 worker threads with one propagator each
in non performance mode (i.e. user actions are active and statistics are
reported after each event and at the end of the simulation)
