/**
 * @brief GeantV implementation of the Geant4 TestEm3 application.
 *
 * The application simulates passage of particles (type and energy configurable) through a simple calorimeter (material,
 * thickness, number of absorbers/layers, secondary production cuts are configurable). The main purpose of the
 * simulation
 * is to generate results for energy deposition and number/type of generated secondaries. However, several other
 * quantities
 * (like energy leakage[both primary and secondary] and energy balance, mean number of charged and neutral
 * steps in the target, mean number of secondary partciles per particle type, transmitting/backscattering coefficients,
 * etc.) will also be collected and reported at the simulation.
